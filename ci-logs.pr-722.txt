Bumped package version to 0.33.4 to satisfy the verify-version-bump check. CI has been re-triggered for commit 97aea4d.\n\nThe weekly usage limit handling (including reset time and PR comment formatting) is present in this branch via usage-limit detection in Claude/Codex/OpenCode paths and GitHub comment formatting. Once CI passes, this should be ready for review.\n\nIf any CI step still fails, I will download and analyze the logs to address it promptly.

Also fixed capturing of the usage limit reset time by assigning `global.limitResetTime` from the tool result in `src/solve.mjs`. This enables auto-continue messaging and PR comments to include the reset time as intended.
