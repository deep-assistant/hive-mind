# Converting Sentry Issues to GitHub Issues - Research Report

## Overview

This document explores all available options for automatically converting Sentry issues into GitHub Issues for the `deep-assistant/hive-mind` project. Our Sentry dashboard is available at: https://deepassistant.sentry.io/issues

## Current Integration Status

The project currently has Sentry integrated for error tracking:
- **Sentry SDK**: `@sentry/node` (v10.15.0) and `@sentry/profiling-node` (v10.15.0)
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive Sentry library at `src/sentry.lib.mjs` with error tracking, breadcrumbs, and performance monitoring
- **No existing GitHub issue creation automation**

## Available Options

### Option 1: Native Sentry GitHub Integration (UI-Based)

Sentry provides a built-in GitHub integration that can be configured through the Sentry web interface.

#### Features:
- **Automatic Issue Creation**: Create GitHub issues automatically via Alert Rules
- **Manual Issue Creation**: Create and link GitHub issues from the Sentry UI
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Link Sentry issues to existing GitHub issues/PRs
- **Code Ownership Integration**: Sync CODEOWNERS file for automatic assignee suggestions
- **Commit Tracking**: Automatically resolve Sentry issues when commits mention `fixes <SENTRY-SHORT-ID>`
- **PR Comments**: Automatic comments on merged PRs suspected of causing issues

#### Setup:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > GitHub** in Sentry
2. Install the GitHub integration (recommended to install from Sentry, not GitHub)
3. Configure Issue Alerts to automatically create GitHub issues
4. Set up alert rules with "Create a new GitHub issue" action

#### Limitations:
- **Requires manual UI configuration** for alert rules
- **Not programmatically controllable** - limited API access to built-in integration
- **Requires Business or Enterprise plan** for automatic issue creation
- **Team plan or higher** required for manual issue management

#### Pricing Impact:
- May require plan upgrade depending on current Sentry subscription

---

### Option 2: Custom Script Using Sentry API + GitHub API

Build a custom Node.js script that periodically fetches Sentry issues and creates corresponding GitHub issues.

#### Implementation Approach:

**Step 1: Fetch Sentry Issues**
```javascript
// Using Sentry REST API v0
const response = await fetch(
  'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/{org_slug}/issues/?query=is:unresolved',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN>'
    }
  }
);
```

**Endpoint Details:**
- **URL**: `GET /api/0/organizations/{organization_id_or_slug}/issues/`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token with `event:read` scope
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `query`: Filter issues (default: `is:unresolved issue.priority:[high,medium]`)
  - `statsPeriod`: Time period (`24h`, `7d`, etc.)
  - `project`: Filter by project IDs
  - `sort`: Sort order (`date`, `new`, `freq`, `user`)
  - `limit`: Max 100 per request

**Step 2: Create GitHub Issues**
```javascript
// Using GitHub REST API
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer <GITHUB_TOKEN>',
      'Accept': 'application/vnd.github+json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: sentryIssue.title,
      body: `**Sentry Issue:** ${sentryIssue.permalink}\n\n${sentryIssue.metadata.value}`,
      labels: ['sentry', 'bug']
    })
  }
);
```

**Step 3: Track Synced Issues**
- Store mapping between Sentry issue IDs and GitHub issue numbers
- Prevent duplicate issue creation
- Options for storage:
  - Local JSON file
  - Database
  - GitHub issue labels/metadata
  - Sentry tags

#### Scheduling Options:
1. **Cron Job**: Run script periodically (e.g., every hour)
2. **GitHub Actions**: Use scheduled workflow
3. **systemd timer**: For server deployments
4. **Docker container**: With scheduler

#### Advantages:
- ✅ Full control over issue format and content
- ✅ No additional service dependencies
- ✅ Can customize filtering and priority logic
- ✅ Can add custom labels, assignees, and metadata
- ✅ Works with any Sentry plan
- ✅ Easily integrated into existing codebase

#### Disadvantages:
- ❌ Requires maintenance
- ❌ Not real-time (depends on polling interval)
- ❌ Need to handle rate limiting for both APIs
- ❌ Must implement state tracking to avoid duplicates
- ❌ Requires secure token storage

#### Implementation Estimate:
- **Initial Development**: 4-6 hours
- **Testing & Refinement**: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 6-9 hours

---

### Option 3: Webhook-Based Automation with GitHub Actions

Use Sentry webhooks to trigger GitHub Actions workflows that create issues in real-time.

#### Architecture:
```
Sentry Issue Event → Webhook → GitHub Actions Workflow → Create GitHub Issue
```

#### Implementation Steps:

**Step 1: Create Sentry Internal Integration**
1. Go to **Settings > Developer Settings > Internal Integrations** in Sentry
2. Create new internal integration
3. Subscribe to webhook events: `issue.created`, `issue.updated`
4. Set webhook URL to GitHub Actions webhook receiver

**Step 2: Set Up GitHub Actions Webhook Receiver**
- Use repository dispatch events or webhook proxy
- Options:
  - **Webhook proxy service** (e.g., smee.io for development)
  - **Self-hosted webhook receiver**
  - **Cloud function** (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)

**Step 3: GitHub Actions Workflow**
```yaml
name: Create GitHub Issue from Sentry
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [sentry-issue]

jobs:
  create-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create GitHub Issue
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const sentryIssue = context.payload.client_payload;
            await github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: sentryIssue.data.issue.title,
              body: `Sentry Issue: ${sentryIssue.data.issue.web_url}`,
              labels: ['sentry', 'automated']
            });
```

#### Webhook Payload Structure:
```json
{
  "action": "created",
  "installation": {
    "uuid": "<installation-uuid>"
  },
  "data": {
    "issue": {
      "id": "<issue-id>",
      "title": "Issue title",
      "web_url": "https://sentry.io/...",
      "project": {...},
      "metadata": {...}
    }
  },
  "actor": {
    "type": "application",
    "id": "sentry",
    "name": "Sentry"
  }
}
```

#### Advantages:
- ✅ Real-time issue creation
- ✅ Event-driven (no polling required)
- ✅ No additional infrastructure if using cloud functions
- ✅ Scalable
- ✅ Works with any Sentry plan

#### Disadvantages:
- ❌ Requires webhook endpoint setup
- ❌ More complex initial setup
- ❌ Need to handle webhook authentication and verification
- ❌ Potential webhook delivery failures require retry logic
- ❌ GitHub Actions has usage limits

#### Implementation Estimate:
- **Initial Development**: 6-8 hours
- **Testing & Deployment**: 3-4 hours
- **Total**: 9-12 hours

2. **GitHub Token**: Use fine-grained PAT with `issues:write` permission
3. **Storage**: Use environment variables or secure secret management
4. **Rotation**: Implement token rotation policy

### Webhook Security
1. **Signature Verification**: Validate webhook signatures from Sentry
2. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS for webhook endpoints
3. **IP Allowlisting**: Restrict webhook sources to Sentry IPs if possible
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints

### Data Privacy
1. **PII Handling**: Be cautious with stack traces containing sensitive data
2. **Error Messages**: Sanitize error messages before creating GitHub issues
3. **Access Control**: Ensure GitHub repository has appropriate access restrictions
4. **Compliance**: Consider GDPR/privacy requirements for error data

## Conclusion

For the `hive-mind` project, we recommend a **two-phase approach**:

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**: Deploy **Pipedream** integration for quick wins
   - Get immediate value from automated issue creation
   - Validate the workflow and issue format
   - Gather feedback from team

2. **Long-term (Month 1-2)**: Develop **custom script** for full control
   - Build tailored solution with advanced features
   - Integrate deeply with existing codebase
   - Eliminate external dependencies
   - Migrate away from Pipedream

This approach balances time-to-value with long-term sustainability and control.
