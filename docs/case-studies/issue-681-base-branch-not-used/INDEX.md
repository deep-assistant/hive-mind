## Key Findings

### The Bug
The `--base-branch` option was ignored during branch creation. The tool created branches from the repository's default branch (main) instead of the user-specified base branch.

### Why It Happened
1. Incomplete implementation of the `--base-branch` feature
2. Git command missing the base branch parameter: `git checkout -b <name>` instead of `git checkout -b <name> <base>`
3. Misleading log messages that suggested correct behavior
4. No automated tests for this scenario

### Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Users**: All users of the `--base-branch` option
- **Symptoms**: Pull requests contain unrelated commits from main branch
- **Workaround**: Available but inconvenient

### Fix Complexity
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Risk**: Low
- **Testing**: Straightforward
- **Deployment**: Can be released immediately as patch

## Code Locations

### Bug Location
- **File**: `src/solve.branch.lib.mjs`
- **Function**: `createOrCheckoutBranch`
- **Line**: 133
- **Issue**: Missing base branch parameter in `git checkout -b` command

### Related Code
- `src/solve.mjs:501` - Calls the buggy function
- `src/solve.config.lib.mjs:178` - Defines CLI option
- `src/solve.auto-pr.lib.mjs:655` - PR creation (works correctly)

## Timeline Summary

| Time | Event | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 14:36:12 | Command executed with `--base-branch feat/perf.t` | ❌ Option provided |
| 14:36:31 | Repository cloned and checked out to `main` | ✅ Normal |
| 14:36:31 | Branch created from `main` instead of `feat/perf.t` | ❌ Bug occurred |
| 14:36:42 | PR creation correctly used `feat/perf.t` as target | ✅ Partially worked |
| Later | User noticed PR contains wrong commits | ❌ Issue discovered |
| 2025-11-05 | Issue #681 reported | 📝 Documented |

## Evidence Summary

### Evidence 1: Command Line
```bash
--base-branch feat/perf.t
```
Source: `first-session-log.txt:10`

### Evidence 2: Branch Creation Log
```
🌿 Creating branch: issue-5-f81abcbe3f46 from main
```
Source: `first-session-log.txt:73`
**Problem**: Should say "from feat/perf.t"

### Evidence 3: PR Target
```
🎯 Target branch: feat/perf.t (custom)
```
Source: `first-session-log.txt:143`
**Note**: PR creation correctly recognized the custom base

### Evidence 4: PR Command
```bash
gh pr create --draft ... --base feat/perf.t --head konard:issue-5-f81abcbe3f46
```
Source: `first-session-log.txt:164`
**Note**: PR command is correct, but branch history is already wrong
