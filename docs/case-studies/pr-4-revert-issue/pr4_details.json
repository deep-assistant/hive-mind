{"body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR adds a unified CI/CD workflow that automatically publishes the `test-anywhere` package to NPM, but only after all tests pass successfully and only if the current version is not already published on NPM.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **New unified workflow file**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`\n  - Runs on all pushes to `main` branch and on all pull requests\n  - Tests across Node.js, Bun, and Deno runtimes in parallel\n  - Only publishes to NPM on `main` branch pushes after all test jobs complete successfully\n  - Checks if the current package version already exists on NPM before publishing\n  - Uses `NPM_TOKEN` secret for authentication\n  \n- **Removed separate workflows**: Deleted `test.yml` and `publish.yml` in favor of single unified workflow\n\n- **Version bump**: Updated `package.json` from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1` to prepare for next release\n\n## How it works\n\n1. On every push to `main` or PR, all three test jobs (Node.js, Bun, Deno) run in parallel\n2. On `main` branch pushes, if all tests pass, the publish job runs (due to `needs: [test-node, test-bun, test-deno]`)\n3. The publish job checks if the current version in `package.json` is already published on NPM\n4. Only if the version is not published yet, the package is published to NPM with public access\n5. If the version already exists, publishing is skipped with a message\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore this workflow can successfully publish, a repository administrator needs to:\n1. Generate an NPM access token with publish permissions\n2. Add it as a repository secret named `NPM_TOKEN` in Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions\n\n## Testing\n\n- All existing tests pass locally and in CI\n- Workflow YAML syntax is valid\n- Publishing step will be tested on first merge to main with a new version number\n\nFixes #3\n\n---\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)","comments":[{"author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"## ü§ñ Solution Draft Log\n\nThis log file contains the complete execution trace of the AI solution draft process.\n\nüìé **Log file uploaded as GitHub Gist** (138KB)\nüîó [View complete solution draft log](https://gist.github.com/konard/b1d5083bdb3297d8013ced7ee0a3104f)\n\n---\n*Now working session is ended, feel free to review and add any feedback on the solution draft.*","createdAt":"2025-10-15T04:39:42Z","id":"IC_kwDOQCrZBc7K7IC7","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/link-foundation/test-anywhere/pull/4#issuecomment-3404497083","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We need to have single CI\u0026CD, where publish only executed if no current version is published and all tests have passed.","createdAt":"2025-10-15T14:34:46Z","id":"IC_kwDOQCrZBc7LD0CN","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/link-foundation/test-anywhere/pull/4#issuecomment-3406774413","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"author":{"login":"konard"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"ü§ñ **AI Work Session Started**\n\nStarting automated work session at 2025-10-15T14:35:46.217Z\n\nThe PR has been converted to draft mode while work is in progress.\n\n_This comment marks the beginning of an AI work session.
