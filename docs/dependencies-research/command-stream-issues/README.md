17. **issue-17-trace-logs-in-ci.mjs** - command-stream emits trace logs when CI=true environment variable is set
18. **issue-18-auto-quoting-control.mjs** - Lack of ability to turn off auto-quoting causes full command strings to be misinterpreted

## Critical Issues

⚠️ **Issue #10 - Git Push Silent Failure**: Git push commands appear to succeed (exit code 0) but don't actually push any data to the remote repository. This causes silent failures in CI/CD pipelines and repository creation scripts. Always use `execSync` for git push operations.

⚠️ **Issue #11 - GitHub PR Create Output Lost**: The `gh pr create` command successfully creates pull requests but command-stream fails to capture the output (PR URL). The stdout is empty even though the command succeeds. This breaks workflows that need to capture and process the created PR URL. Always use `execSync` for gh pr create operations.

⚠️ **Issue #12 - GitHub Search Query Escaping**: GitHub search queries with labels containing spaces fail due to multiple layers of escaping. The query `label:"help wanted"` becomes `label:\\\"help wanted\\\"` causing API errors. Use `execSync` or carefully construct array arguments.

⚠️ **Issue #13 - Complex Shell Command Escaping**: Commands with multi-line strings, nested quotes, or special characters fail unpredictably. This affects git commits with detailed messages, GitHub PR descriptions, and any complex shell operations. Use temp files or `execSync` for complex content.

⚠️ **Issue #14 - CWD with CD Pattern Failure**: The pattern `$`cd ${dir} && command`` doesn't work as expected. Commands appear to succeed but don't actually execute in the specified directory. This causes critical failures with git operations where files aren't staged or committed despite success codes. Always use `$({ cwd: dir })`command`` instead.

⚠️ **Issue #17 - Trace Logs in CI Environment**: When the `CI` environment variable is set to `true` (as in GitHub Actions), command-stream emits trace logs to stderr in the format `[TRACE 2025-01-14T12:34:56.789Z] ...`. These logs appear even with `mirror: false` and `capture: true` options, breaking JSON parsing and causing test failures. Workaround: redirect stderr with `2>/dev/null` or filter trace logs from output.

⚠️ **Issue #18 - Auto-Quoting Control**: command-stream lacks the ability to turn off auto-quoting, which causes full command strings to be misinterpreted as quoted commands. This breaks telegram bot command execution and similar use cases where pre-constructed command strings need to be executed. Always use `child_process.spawn()` or `execSync()` for commands requiring precise argument control.

## Running the Tests

Each issue can be tested independently:

```bash
# With Node.js (recommended)
node ./issue-01-multiline-strings.mjs

# With Bun (may have shell path issues)
bun ./issue-01-multiline-strings.mjs

# Run all tests
for script in issue-*.mjs; do echo "=== $script ==="; node "$script"; done
```

## Summary of Best Practices

1. **For file operations with complex content:**
   - Use `fs.writeFile()` instead of echo with interpolation
   - Use heredocs for shell scripts that need multi-line content

2. **For GitHub CLI with complex markdown:**
   - Use `--body-file` parameter instead of `--body` with interpolation
   - Write content to temp file first, then reference it

3. **For error handling:**
   - Use `error.code`, not `error.exitCode`
   - Check for `error.stdout` and `error.stderr` for debugging

4. **For JSON data:**
   - Write to file with `fs.writeFile` instead of echo
   - Avoid shell interpolation of complex JSON strings

5. **For paths with spaces:**
   - Always quote paths in shell commands
   - Consider using fs operations when possible

6. **For Bun compatibility:**
   - Be aware of shell path issues
   - Consider using Node.js for scripts that heavily rely on shell commands

7. **For directory-specific commands:**
   - Never use `$`cd ${dir} && command`` pattern
   - Always use `$({ cwd: dir })`command`` instead
   - The cd pattern fails silently, leaving commands executing in wrong directory

## General Principle

When dealing with user-generated or complex content, prefer Node.js fs operations over shell commands to avoid escaping issues entirely.

## UX Evaluation of command-stream Library

### Strengths
1. **Clean syntax** - The `$` template literal provides an elegant, bash-like syntax
2. **Cross-runtime support** - Works with both Node.js and Bun (with caveats)
3. **Streaming support** - Ability to handle real-time output via `.stream()`
4. **Promise-based** - Modern async/await support

### Pain Points
1. **Shell escaping complexity** - Interpolation of complex strings fails silently or unexpectedly
2. **Automatic quote addition** - `"${variable}"` syntax adds unwanted single quotes to output
3. **Inconsistent error API** - Uses `error.code` instead of standard `error.exitCode`
4. **Bun compatibility issues** - Shell path problems make it unreliable with Bun runtime
5. **Poor error messages** - Escaping failures often produce cryptic or misleading errors
6. **Documentation gaps** - Many edge cases and best practices are undocumented

### Developer Experience Issues

#### 1. Escaping Surprises
- **Expected**: String interpolation "just works"
- **Reality**: Complex strings with quotes, backticks, or newlines break commands
- **Impact**: Developers waste time debugging shell escaping issues

#### 2. Automatic Quote Addition (Critical Issue #9)
- **Expected**: `"${variable}"` passes the variable value cleanly
- **Reality**: command-stream adds single quotes, resulting in `'value'` instead of `value`
- **Impact**: GitHub issues/PRs get titles with quotes, data corruption in production
- **Workaround**: Must use `child_process.execSync()` instead for precise string handling

#### 3. Error Handling Confusion
- **Expected**: Standard Node.js error properties (`exitCode`)
- **Reality**: Custom property names (`code`)
- **Impact**: Copy-pasted error handling code fails

#### 4. Runtime Inconsistency
- **Expected**: Same behavior across Node.js and Bun
- **Reality**: Bun fails with ENOENT errors for basic commands
- **Impact**: Scripts work in development but fail in production

#### 5. Silent Failures
- **Expected**: Clear errors when commands fail
- **Reality**: Some escaping issues cause silent data corruption
- **Impact**: Bugs reach production undetected

## Recommendations for command-stream Library

### For Library Maintainers

1. **Improve shell escaping**
   - Automatically escape special characters in interpolated strings
   - Provide a `.raw()` method for when escaping is not desired
   - Add warnings for potentially problematic characters

2. **Standardize error interface**
   - Use `exitCode` instead of `code` for consistency
   - Provide better error messages for common issues
   - Include the actual command that failed in error output

3. **Fix Bun compatibility**
   - Handle symlinked shells properly
   - Provide fallback shell detection
   - Document runtime-specific limitations

4. **Enhance documentation**
   - Add a troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Provide more examples with complex real-world scenarios
   - Document all edge cases and workarounds

5. **Add safety features**
   - Option to validate/sanitize inputs
   - Dry-run mode to preview commands
   - Built-in protection against injection attacks

### For Developers Using command-stream

1. **Critical: Avoid quote interpolation bug**
   ```javascript
   // DON'T: This adds unwanted single quotes to the output!
   await $`gh issue create --title "${title}"`;
   // Results in: issue title becomes 'My Title' instead of: My Title
   
   // WORKAROUND: Use child_process for precise string handling
   const { execSync } = await import('child_process');
   const command = `gh issue create --title "${title}"`;
   execSync(command, { encoding: 'utf8' });
   ```

2. **Defensive coding practices**
   ```javascript
   // DON'T: Direct interpolation of user content
   await $`echo "${userContent}" > file.txt`;
   
   // DO: Use fs operations for complex content
   await fs.writeFile('file.txt', userContent);
   ```

3. **Error handling pattern**
   ```javascript
   try {
     const result = await $`command`;
   } catch (error) {
     // Use error.code, not error.exitCode
     if (error.code !== 0) {
       console.error('Command failed:', error.stderr?.toString());
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Runtime detection**
   ```javascript
   const runtime = process.versions.bun ? 'bun' : 'node';
   if (runtime === 'bun') {
     // Use fs operations or handle differently
   }
   ```

5. **Safe patterns for common tasks**
   - File operations: Use `fs` module
   - JSON handling: Write to temp file first
   - Complex strings: Use heredocs or base64 encoding
   - Path handling: Always quote paths with spaces
   - **Git push/pull**: Use execSync instead of command-stream (critical issue #10)
   - **GitHub PR creation**: Use execSync for `gh pr create` to capture PR URL (critical issue #11)
   - Authentication operations: Fall back to child_process when command-stream fails silently
   - **CI environments**: Add `2>/dev/null` to commands or filter trace logs (critical issue #17)
   - **Full command strings**: Use spawn() or execSync() for pre-constructed commands (critical issue #18)

## Alternative Approaches

If command-stream issues become blockers, consider:

1. **execa** - More mature, better escaping, extensive documentation
2. **zx** by Google - Similar syntax, better error handling
3. **Node.js child_process** - Direct control, no abstraction layer
4. **Pure fs operations** - Avoid shell entirely for file operations

## CI/CD Specific Issues

### Issue #17: Trace Logs in CI Environment
When `CI=true` is set (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.), command-stream emits verbose trace logs to stderr:

```javascript
// This breaks in CI
const result = await $`echo '{"status":"ok"}'`;
JSON.parse(result.stdout); // Fails due to trace logs mixed in

// Workaround 1: Redirect stderr
const result = await $`echo '{"status":"ok"}' 2>/dev/null`;

// Workaround 2: Filter trace logs
const output = result.stdout.split('\n')
  .filter(line => !line.startsWith('[TRACE'))
  .join('\n');
```

See `issue-17-technical-analysis.md` for detailed analysis.

## Conclusion

While command-stream offers an elegant syntax for shell operations, it currently has significant UX issues that can lead to frustration and bugs. The library would benefit from:
- Better automatic escaping
- Standardized error handling
- Improved Bun compatibility
- Option to disable trace logs in CI
- Comprehensive documentation

Until these issues are addressed, developers should:
- Prefer fs operations over shell commands
- Always test with actual production data
- Have fallback strategies for shell operations
- Test in CI environment before deployment
- Consider alternative libraries for critical applications
