log(`📊 GitHub CLI Rate Limit Analysis - Key Findings\n`);

log(`🔍 1. RATE LIMIT ERROR PATTERNS DETECTED:`);
log(`   ✓ Primary rate limit error: "You have exceeded a secondary rate limit"`);
log(`   ✓ Error format: "HTTP 403: You have exceeded a secondary rate limit. Please wait a few minutes before you try again..."`);
log(`   ✓ Pattern includes: Request ID and API endpoint URL`);
log(`   ✓ Secondary rate limits trigger when making too many requests in a short period\n`);

log(`🔍 2. SEARCH API BEHAVIOR:`);
log(`   ✓ Search API has stricter rate limits than repository listing API`);
log(`   ✓ Search API: 30 requests per minute (resets every minute)`);
log(`   ✓ Secondary rate limit triggers when requesting large amounts of data`);
log(`   ✓ Large page sizes (>100) can trigger secondary rate limits faster`);
log(`   ✓ Search API works but can return empty results for very broad queries\n`);

log(`🔍 3. REPOSITORY LISTING API:`);
log(`   ✓ Repository listing API is more reliable and has higher limits`);
log(`   ✓ Successfully handles large page sizes (tested up to 1000)`);
log(`   ✓ Works well as a fallback when search API is rate limited`);
log(`   ✓ Does not trigger secondary rate limits as easily\n`);

log(`🔍 4. FALLBACK STRATEGY VALIDATION:`);
log(`   ✓ When search API fails, repository listing API still works`);
log(`   ✓ Fallback strategy is viable and effective`);
log(`   ✓ Repository API can handle the same page sizes that cause search API to fail\n`);

log(`🔍 5. MAXIMUM PAGE SIZES:`);
log(`   ✓ Search API: Maximum practical limit appears to be 100-200 items`);
log(`   ✓ Repository API: Can handle 1000+ items successfully`);
log(`   ✓ GitHub's official maximum is 100 per page, but some APIs accept higher values`);
log(`   ✓ Higher limits increase risk of hitting secondary rate limits\n`);

log(`🚨 RATE LIMIT ERROR DETECTION PATTERNS:`);
log(`   To detect rate limit errors, check for these patterns in error messages:`);
log(`   • "rate limit" (case insensitive)`);
log(`   • "HTTP 403" combined with rate-related terms`);
log(`   • "secondary rate limit"`);
log(`   • "Please wait" or "wait a few minutes"`);
log(`   • "exceeded.*limit" (regex pattern)`);
log(`   • "abuse detection" (GitHub's abuse detection mechanism)\n`);

log(`💡 IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS:`);
log(`   1. Use fetchAllIssuesWithPagination() function that already exists`);
log(`   2. Add rate limit detection to that function`);
log(`   3. When rate limit detected, fallback to repository listing API`);
log(`   4. Use maximum page size of 100 for search API (safer)`);
log(`   5. Use higher page sizes (1000) for repository listing API`);
log(`   6. Add proper delays between requests (5+ seconds)`);
log(`   7. Monitor X-RateLimit headers when possible\n`);

const rateLimitDetectionCode = `
// Rate limit detection function
function isRateLimitError(error) {
  const errorText = (error.stderr?.toString() || error.stdout?.toString() || error.message || '').toLowerCase();

log(`🎯 NEXT STEPS:`);
log(`   1. Update fetchAllIssuesWithPagination() in github.lib.mjs`);
log(`   2. Add rate limit detection with proper patterns`);
log(`   3. Implement fallback to repository listing API`);
log(`   4. Test the implementation with various scenarios`);
log(`   5. Update page size recommendations based on findings`);
