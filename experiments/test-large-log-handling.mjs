console.log('📋 Large Log Handling Example');
console.log('This example demonstrates how solve.mjs now handles logs that exceed GitHub comment limits.\n');

console.log('🔧 Solution Summary:');
console.log('1. Check if log comment exceeds GitHub\'s 65,536 character limit');
console.log('2. If too long, create a GitHub Gist instead of inline comment');
console.log('3. Post a comment with a link to the Gist');
console.log('4. Fallback to truncated comment if Gist creation fails');
console.log('5. Handle both PR and issue comment scenarios\n');

console.log('📏 Size Limits:');
console.log('  GitHub Comment Limit: 65,536 characters');
console.log('  GitHub File Upload Limit: 25 MB');
console.log('  Solution: Use GitHub Gists for large logs\n');

console.log('🚀 Usage:');
console.log('  When running solve.mjs with --attach-logs, large logs are automatically handled:');
console.log('  • Small logs: Embedded directly in comments');
console.log('  • Large logs: Uploaded as Gists with comment links');
console.log('  • Failed uploads: Graceful fallback to truncated comments\n');

console.log('✅ This resolves issue #105: "Logs were not uploaded due to comment body limit"');
